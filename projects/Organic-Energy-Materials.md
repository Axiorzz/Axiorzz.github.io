This collection include 3 main projects, first carried out in the Lab. and later investigated and analyzed:

- Electropolymerization of Aniline
- Organic Redox Flow Batteries
- Excited States of Donor - Acceptors materials

---------------------------
## Electropolymerization of Aniline
----
This project investigates the formation of PoliAnilline (PANI) on a transparent conducting electrode. The polymers' optical absorbtion, redox states, and oxidative stability have been studied, in order to gain a deeper understanding of the electrodeposition and electrochemical synthesis. Results were obtained through the use of cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry (CA) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy experiments. The data have been gathered using PsTrace and have been plotted using Python and Excel.

## Organic Redox Flow Batteries
-----
This project investigates the properties of a static organic redox (flow) battery. The properties studied include the: redox potential, cell voltage, capacity, efficiency, state of charge, and volumetric energy density. Finally, the report touches upon the amount of Alizarin Red S (ARS) negolyte required to store the amount of energy that corresponds to the average power consumption of a typical household.  Results were obtained through the use of cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry (CA) and the Charge - Discharge experiment. The data have been gathered using PsTrace and have been plotted using Python and Excel.

 ## Excited States of Donor - Acceptors materials
 ----   
This project investigates a set of organic donor-acceptor (D-A) molecules. The different sets of molecules have been investigated through ground state optimization and electronic structure calculations. This has been done using the Amsterdam Modeling Suite to first create the molecules, optimize their geometry and perform the different analysis.
