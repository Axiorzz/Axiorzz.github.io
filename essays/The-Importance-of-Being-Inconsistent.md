In this small project, we had been given and assigned a publication in the DFT field to read, critically analyze, understand, review and finally present to our peers in the easiest and clearest way possible in the form of a 15 minute video presentation.

Here's a link to the referred paper: [https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-physchem-052516-044957]()

To understand the paper, a lot of research from the 3 members of the group has been involved. 
In order to present the latter, I have decided to use means such as: Gifs, Videos and Memes specifically designed and created in the process, in order to convey the informations in the lightest, most practical and most innovative way I could think of.
